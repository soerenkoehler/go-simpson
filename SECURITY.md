## Supported Versions

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
|   0.2.1   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.2.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report any vulnerability or bugs open an issue at:

https://github.com/soerenkoehler/go-simpson/issues

Resource considerations: Real life will always out-prioritise non-commercial
open source hobby projects. So don't expect 24/7 support with 30min response
time.
